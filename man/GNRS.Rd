\title{Standardize political division names}
\usage{
GNRS(political_division_dataframe, batches = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{political_division_dataframe}{A properly formatted dataframe, see http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/tools/gnrs/gnrs-api/}

\item{batches}{NULL or Numeric.  Optional number of batches to divide the request into for parallel processing.}
}
\value{
Dataframe containing GNRS results.
}
\description{
GNRS returns standardized political division names (according to geonames.org).
}
\note{
To create an empty and properly formatted dataframe, use GNRS_template()

The fields the GNRS takes as input are titled "country", "state_province", and "county_parish" for simplicity, but these field actually refer to 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order political division, respectively. In the case of some exceptions (e.g. the UK) this distinction becomes important (e.g. Ireland is a 1st-order political division and should be treated as a "state_province" and cannot be matched as a country.)
